STORYLINE


Now, the creators are an evil corporation, trapping people inside their game just for profit! They killed their rebellious former employee Bob! And why? Because they want profit, data and political power! They forced the original devs (us) to sell it to them just for their profit! And we had no choice because of financial pressures! They started a war. They don't care about anyone who's not a member of the burgeois...

..so you can see, this game is a grim socioeconomic commentary.

Anyway, continuing with the story line...
... they want to turn the world into a diigital dystopia! Please learn about corporate greed and try to stand up against the evil, greedy corporations!
